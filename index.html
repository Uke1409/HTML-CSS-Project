    <!--Homepage Intro-->
        <p id = "homePageIntro">Look up! Do you know this character? This guy is one of the most famous anime characters of all time. His show
           is called “Naruto.” This website will be about distinctive character backstories, urban legends and historical figures who
           have influenced the backgrounds of characters, and hidden easter eggs in the show. By the time I finish, you'll want to
           rewatch Naruto more than 17 times. Believe it!
