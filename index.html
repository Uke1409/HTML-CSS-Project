    <!--Homepage Intro-->
        <p id = "homepageintro">Look up! Do you know this guy? He is one of the most famous anime characters of all time. His show is called “Naruto.”
           This website will be about distinctive character backstories, urban legends and historical figures who have influenced
           the backgrounds of characters, and hidden easter eggs in the show. By the time I finish, you'll want to rewatch Naruto
           more than 17 times. Believe it!
